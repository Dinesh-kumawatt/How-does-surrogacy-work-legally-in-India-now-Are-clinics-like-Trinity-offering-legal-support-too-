# How-does-surrogacy-work-legally-in-India-now-Are-clinics-like-Trinity-offering-legal-support-too-

Surrogacy laws in India changed in 2022. Only altruistic surrogacy is allowed now. That means the surrogate cannot be paid, and only close relatives (married, already having a child) can become surrogates. No commercial surrogacy anymore.

Couples must be Indian citizens, married for at least 5 years, and medically proven infertile. They need a court order and approval from a government board. The surrogate also needs medical and psychological approval.

It sounds a bit complex, right? Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s very important to choose a clinic that offers full legal guidance. Trinity IVF helps couples navigate these rules. They work with legal consultants to get documents ready, check eligibility, and ensure everything is done safely and legally.

They also help you find surrogates if needed and ensure that the whole process is smooth. The baby is legally handed over to the intended parents with proper documentation.

Surrogacy is emotional and sensitive. Legal clarity is a must. Clinics like Trinity do not hide any stepsâ€”they guide you at each stage with transparency.
